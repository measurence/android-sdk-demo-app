# Measurence

Measurence's mission is to transform retail stores into "physical websites", by providing:

1. actionable knowledge about customers behavior into the stores
1. marketing solutions and technologies aimed at improving the customers engagement and loyalty

As a primary source of Knowledge, Measurence install and manages a network of WiFi sensors which collect anonymized and aggregated information about foot traffic within retail stores.

Measurence crunches this information in order to deliver its own analytics solution, and also distributes it to partners in order to provide the highest possible value to the stakeholders.

# Measurence API Platform

In order to implement an effective and efficient distribution to its partners of the collected information, Measurence has create an "API Platform".

The Measurence API Platform is currently intended to serve 3 use cases:

* a mobile app, which subscribes to receive customers "session updates" (related to the device where it's installed) via push notification (e.g. Google Cloud Messaging)
* a mobile app, which subscribes to receive customers "session updates" (related to the device where it's installed) to its Back End servers
* a Back End server of a Measurence partner, which subscribes to receive "session updates" of _ALL_ devices captured by the Measurence sensors
